                        <p>The small, five square mile island of Saba lies in the northeastern Caribbean Sea,
                            some twenty-eight miles southeast of the island of St. Maarten.</p>

                        <p>The coastline of Saba is mostly rubble and rocky cliffs that are 100 metres (330 ft) or taller with no permanent beaches.
                            The steep terrain and sheer bluffs dropping almost straight down to the ocean&apos;s edge 
                            prevents the formation of mangrove swamps or much vegetation.</p>

                        <p>With a runway just 400 metres (1,312 feet) long and a challenging approach,
                            pilots must have special training to land at the Dutch Caribbean island airport.
                            Only certain turboprop aircraft such as the BN-2 Islander or Grand Caravan are agile enough to perform the short stop required.</p>

                <h2 class="title capitalize">Saba&apos;s Inhabitants</h2>

                <p>With just under 2,000 inhabitants, 
                    it is the smallest territory or sovereign state by permanent population in the Americas.</p>

                </figure>
                <p>Goats are the island’s main livestock, and the number
                        is very high, with many roaming freely. The impact of these
                        goats on Saba’s vegetation has been significant. Goats cause
                        extensive damage to the vegetation because of their preference
                        for young seedlings, twigs and germinating plants, preventing
                        the natural regeneration of plant species.</p>

                <h2 class="title capitalize">Mt. Scenery</h2>

                <p>Mt. Scenery is the highest point in the Dutch Kingdom (877m or 2877ft) and is Saba’s dominant feature.
                        Dense vegetation with a variety of species cover the summit and upper slopes.  The Elfin Forest (cloud-forest)
                        dominates the upper 50m (150ft) of the mountain and is comprised
                        of Mountain Mahogany covered with Epiphytes, Orchids and a myriad of other unique and rare plants.   Hiking up the 1064 steps
                        to the summit is challenging but not too difficult for average hikers.  At the top,
                        you will be rewarded with amazing views if you reach it on a clear day.</p>

                    <p>Saba plunges below the sea as steeply as she rises above. 
                        From shallow patch reefs to deep underwater seamounts, 
                        Saba offers sites suitable for any diver’s level of experience. 
                        Past volcanic activity has created spectacular formations and structures. 
                        Underwater lava flows and hot springs are the most obvious evidence of Saba’s volcanic origins.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p>The reefs are populated with schools of tropical fish and healthy coral. 
                        Sheer close-to-shore walls are covered with sponges of all sizes and the 
                        heavily encrusted deep-water seamounts attract pelagic creatures that are 
                        not normally seen by divers. Unusual and exciting sightings are always possible 
                        in Saba’s waters including frequent shark encounters.
